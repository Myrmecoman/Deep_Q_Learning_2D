# Deep_Q_Learning_2D

The repo contains a Unity project (DQN_2D), the built project for windows (build), and the necessary code to train a DQN on this game (code_DQN).
Try to launch the game before launching the training to understand its concept.

The training script is in charge to launch the game and take screenshots at every step to retrieve the score using an OCR (tesseract) and the environment.
The source code for training is highly inspired from this tutorial : https://keras.io/examples/rl/deep_q_network_breakout/

The training might take a very long time for not so conclusive results, I did not train for long enough yet to notice a change in behavior.
